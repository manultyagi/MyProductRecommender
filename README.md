# MyProductRecommender
The E-commerce Product Recommender is an intelligent web application designed to enhance the online shopping experience through personalized product suggestions and AI-powered explanations. It leverages a recommendation engine that analyzes user behavior — such as browsing patterns, previous purchases, and interests — to identify products most relevant to each user. What sets this project apart is its integration with a Large Language Model (LLM), which provides natural, human-like explanations for every recommendation. Instead of simply displaying products, the system explains why an item is being suggested, making the process more transparent and trustworthy for users.

The application combines a robust backend that manages data and recommendation logic with a clean, responsive frontend dashboard that displays the results in an intuitive and visually appealing manner. Each recommended product card includes essential details like product image, name, price, and an AI-generated explanation. The interface follows a warm and subtle theme, with soft tones, rounded elements, and a minimal layout that ensures a friendly and distraction-free user experience.

Overall, this project aims to bridge the gap between complex recommendation algorithms and user understanding by combining data-driven personalization with the clarity of natural language explanations — making online shopping smarter, more engaging, and user-centric.
